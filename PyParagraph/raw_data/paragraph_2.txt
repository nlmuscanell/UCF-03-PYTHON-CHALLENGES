For months, protesters have chanted it in the streets, blasted it on social media and plastered it on signs at demonstrations, spreading the message seemingly everywhere across Louisville: Arrest the police who killed Breonna Taylor.

After Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot during a police raid at her apartment in March, the call to hold three officers accountable became a nationwide rallying cry, fueling nationwide protests against racial injustice.

But with the results of a criminal investigation into those officers expected as soon as this week, Kentucky’s largest city is bracing for what may be the most explosive development yet in the high-profile fallout over Taylor’s death.

The city’s police leadership has declared “a state of emergency” and canceled all days off, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal, as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) said he is prepared to deploy the National Guard to quell possible demonstrations. The news comes as six officers are reportedly under investigation by the Louisville Metro Police Department for their role in the drug raid that ended in Taylor’s death.

Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R) is expected to announce whether the three officers who fired into Taylor’s apartment while executing a “no-knock” search warrant will be charged. He can bring a case to a grand jury, which could indict the officers, but Cameron has previously declined to discuss the specifics of a timeline.

Yet, following a summer of widespread protests over the police killings of Black people — from Minneapolis to Kenosha, Wis., and far beyond — his decision may be seen as a litmus test over questions of accountability for law enforcement officials implicated in such incidents.
